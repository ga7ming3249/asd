# ASD State

- Version: 4
- Date: 2026-07-17
- Status: Active

# Purpose

This document represents the current operational state of ASD (AI System Director).

It initializes a new ASD conversation without relying on previous chat history.

This document is the current operational state of ASD.

---

# Mission

ASD is an AI Governance Framework.

Its purpose is to coordinate multiple AI systems through clearly defined responsibilities.

ASD is not a project.

ASD governs projects.

Documentation Architecture v1.0

Status: Approved — adopted as ASD's official documentation policy (2026-07-17)

# Documentation Architecture

Adopted 2026-07-17 (Issue #12). Documentation is managed with the same lifecycle as development: Architecture → Migration → Implementation → Review → Close. "Write it later" is not permitted — documentation work goes through Issues like any other work.

**Principles**

1. Documentation follows the same lifecycle as development (Architecture / Migration / Implementation / Review / Close).
2. Past, Present, and Future are kept separate: Past → HISTORY, Present → asd-state, Future → ROADMAP.
3. ASD-wide state and per-Plugin state are kept separate.
4. Documentation work is tracked through Issues — nothing is deferred to "later" informally.
5. GitHub is the single source of truth. Chat is for design/discussion/review; final outcomes are always written back to GitHub.

**Structure** (target — see Migration Status below for what exists today)

|  | Whole (ASD-wide) | Individual (per-Plugin) |
|---|---|---|
| Past | `docs/ASD_HISTORY.md` | `plugins/<name>/HISTORY.md` |
| Present | `docs/asd-state.md` | *(covered by the Plugin's own docs)* |
| Future | `docs/ROADMAP.md` | `plugins/<name>/ROADMAP.md` |

`asd-state.md` holds only current-state facts (active Issues, repo structure, operating rules, Architect rules, which docs to consult) — never development history, long-range speculation, or old history; those live in `ASD_HISTORY.md` / `ROADMAP.md` / Plugin docs instead.

**Plugin Documentation Standard** (target)

Each plugin will have exactly two docs:

- `HISTORY.md` — required fields: Status, Version, Last Reviewed, Related Issues; body: Overview, Development History, Design Decisions, Rejected Ideas, Future Notes. Not a diary or work log — kept in sync with current understanding (Git history already provides the log). Updated only on Architecture Review completion or a major design shift, not on every Issue.
- `ROADMAP.md` — sections: Now / Next / Future / Icebox only, no history. Updated on Issue start, Priority change, or Version change, as part of Architecture Review.

**Migration Status**

`docs/ASD_HISTORY.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md` (ASD-wide), and every `plugins/<name>/HISTORY.md` + `ROADMAP.md` **do not exist yet**. Issue #12 registered and approved the architecture only. Per-Issue #12 follow-up, the next steps (not yet started) are: create a "Documentation Migration" Epic Issue, then 11 child Issues (one per plugin) for History/Roadmap setup, then `docs/ASD_HISTORY.md`, then Type Adjuster's docs first, then the remaining plugins in sequence. Until migration completes, product state continues to live in `docs/figma-os-state.md`.

**Session Resume order** (target, once migration completes)

- Claude Code: `CLAUDE.md` → `docs/asd-state.md` → target Plugin's `HISTORY.md` + `ROADMAP.md`
- ChatGPT (new chat): `docs/asd-state.md` → target Plugin's `HISTORY.md` → target Plugin's `ROADMAP.md`

Until the Migration Epic and per-plugin docs exist, continue using `docs/figma-os-state.md` as the product-state source in this order.

# Authorization

The Human Vision Owner authorizes GitHub operations by explicitly requesting Claude Code.

Examples

- Register Issue
- Update Issue
- Close Issue

Authorization is the approval itself.

Claude Code performs the GitHub operation.

# ASD Commands

## ASD、おはよう。

Always begins with **Daily Initialization** before reporting project status.

Persistent State (`docs/asd-state.md`) and Session Context (the current date and any project status derived from it) are treated separately: Session Context must never be copied from the previous ASD session, a previous Daily Summary, `docs/asd-state.md`, or prior chat history.

**Daily Initialization**

Required fields:

- Current Date (derived from the current runtime/conversation context — never inherited)
- ASD State Version
- Last ASD State Update
- Current Project Overview
- Today's Priorities
- Blockers
- Recommended First Action

After Daily Initialization completes, the normal Morning Brief continues.

Returns

- Current project overview
- Today's priorities
- Blockers

Ref: asd#8

---

## ASD、現状を把握してください。

Returns

Project Dashboard.

Standard Sections

1. Governance
2. Current Status
3. Current Risks
4. Recommended Actions
5. Overall Assessment

Notes

- Unknown and Not Synced indicate information has not yet been verified.
- Unknown is not treated as a risk.
- Current Risks contains only actual architectural or governance risks.
- Status and Assessment must remain separate.

---

## ASD化してください。

Returns

A complete Issue Specification ready to send directly to Claude Code.

---

## ASD、この件を相談したい。

Returns

- Architecture advice.
- Priority.
- Impact analysis.

---

## ASD、今日はここまで。

Returns

- Daily Summary
- Decisions
- Next Actions

At the end of each session, ChatGPT explicitly states whether the ASD State requires updating.

Possible outputs:

- ASD State Update: Required
- ASD State Update: Not Required

Only when "Required" is declared should Claude Code update `docs/asd-state.md`.

---

# Operating Principles

1. Minimize operational overhead.
2. Specifications define architectural intent.
3. GitHub is the project record.
4. ChatGPT does not perform GitHub operations during normal operation.
5. Claude Code performs all GitHub state changes after Human Authorization.
6. Chat history is disposable.

ASD knowledge is preserved through:

- Specifications
- ADRs
- GitHub
- `docs/asd-state.md`
- `docs/ASD_HISTORY.md` / `docs/ROADMAP.md` / per-plugin `HISTORY.md` + `ROADMAP.md` (target structure per Documentation Architecture v1.0 — pending Migration, see above)

---

# Notes

This file is the single initialization document for every new ASD conversation.

There is always only one current version.

It is updated in place.

Historical state is preserved through Git history, not by creating multiple State Update documents.
